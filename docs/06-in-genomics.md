# Gene Set Enrichment Analysis in Genomics

## Overview

Given a list of genomic regions, what are the biological functions they relate. A nature solution is to first annotate
genomic regions to the nearest TSS, then only use genes with a certain distance for ORA analysis. In this chapter, we will
discuss the problems of directly apply ORA on genomic data and the solutions.

## The GREAT method



## The rGREAT package

## The Lola package

## RNASeq and methylation-adjusted ORA

## SNP-based GSEA


## general comments

E.g. large sample size

compare between different sets of genomic regions
